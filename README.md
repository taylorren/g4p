Go4Pro.org, a collection of registers' contribution on programming topics. 

The flow is simple: 

1. Register with us to get a user account. We will require a site with RSS feature and also have programming contents. 
2. For those you wish to be collected and published in our site, a very tiny HTML code is required to be inserted into the content of your post that you wish to share. All articles will be published in our site under CC-BY-NC. 
3. And that's it!

We started this project a few years back. It was developed with PHP (Symfony 2) as the frontend and Python as the backend robot. 

Our site is hosted at http://www.go4pro.org.

Last but not the least, "g4p" stands for:

**Go for Programming, Go for Professionals. **
