Go4Pro.org, a collection of registers' contribution on programming topics. 

The flow is simple: 

1. Register with us to get a user account. We will require a site with RSS feature and also have programming contents. 
2. For those you wish to be collected and published in our site, a very tiny HTML code is required to be inserted into the content of your post that you wish to share. 
3. And that's it!

We started this project a few years back. It was developed with PHP (Symfony 2) as the frontend and Python as the backend robot.
